## About the Repository

This repository is dedicated to the **CCIR Program**, encompassing a series of scripts designed for advanced biomedical imaging and deep learning tasks. The scripts include homework assignments, foundation models, and various deep learning applications in medical imaging.

## Scripts Overview

### Script Code 1: Tissue Classification with Deep Learning

**Description**: Train a model for classifying tissue samples into benign vs. malign using a deep learning architecture.

**Code**: [script_dem_1.ipynb](script_code_1/script_dem_1.ipynb)

**Environment Setup**:
```bash
conda create -n image_processing_env python=3.8
conda activate image_processing_env
conda install -c conda-forge pandas scikit-learn matplotlib numpy pillow tensorflow
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=image_processing_env --display-name "Python (image_processing_env)"
